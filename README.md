# Digiac-3080

The [Digiac-3080](https://digiac3080.wordpress.com/ "Extinct Computer Tribute Blog")
was the first computer architecture I learned.  This simple slow serial machine
with no interrupts or stack could still educate and entertain.  I saved one
program, a Stock Market game, from those days and wrote an emulator to be able
to run the game again.

### Documentation Files
These files explain the Digiac and how to run the emulator.
